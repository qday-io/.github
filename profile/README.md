## 🙋‍♀️ What's QDay?
QDay is a quantum-resistant, EVM-compatible Layer 2 blockchain built on the Abelian blockchain. It is designed to enhance security against quantum computing threats while providing scalability, interoperability, and efficient transaction processing.QDay integrates a hybrid PoS-over-PoW consensus mechanism, combining the security of Proof of Work with the energy efficiency and scalability of Proof of Stake. It offers features such as a blockchain explorer, MetaMask integration, a faucet system, decentralized exchanges, and cross-chain bridges, all within a secure testing environment called QDay Testnet. The total supply of QDAY tokens is 22,517,998,100, mirroring the supply of ABEL, with governance managed by the QDay DAO.
